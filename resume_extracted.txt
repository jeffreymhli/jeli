Experience

2025.05 - Present | Quantum Information Research Intern

Qian Lab, UofT

· Generated hyperentangled photon pairs via type-0 SPDC in pure-silica periodically poled silica fiber.

· Designed and built an optical coincidence counting device using Excelitas SPCM and IDQube single-photon counting modules.

· Programmed a quantum state tomography pipeline in MATLAB and Python,including maximum-likelihood density-matrix reconstruction and entanglement-metric evaluation.

· Designed and fabricated a low-jitter TTL gating circuit for photon detector based on a monostable
multivibrator to generate nanosecond-scale timing windows, suppress dark-counts, and increase
coincidence-to-accidental ratio. [Matlab / PCB / Fiber Optics]

2024.05 - 2025.05 | Quantum Optics Research Intern

Braverman Lab, UofT

· Simulated Hermite­Gaussian mode propagation through a spatial filtering system to analyze mode purity and phase evolution.

· Optimized filter properties to achieve >95% HG0 mode fidelity using Dual Annealing optimization.

· Constructed a Mach­Zehnder interferometer to perform holography of the filtered spatial mode

· Modeled resonant modes in disordered optical cavities using COMSOL.

· Trained a feedforward neural network to predict output wavelength from the disordered optical cavities, achieving a mean squared error of 1.2nm.

· Designed and fabricated a low-vibration mechanical optical shutter with an 8 ms switching period and
closed loop feedback calibration. [Scipy / COMSOL / Pytorch / PCB]

2024.09 - Present | UTMIST QuDiffuse Project Lead

UTMIST, UofT

· QuDiffuse: Applying the D-Wave quantum annealer to accelerate Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model(DDPM) training by employing RBM in Markov chain

· Achieved 10x training speedup on MNIST data set compared to classical DDPM using classical QUBO solver.

· Awarded "Most Innovative Project" at UTMIST 2025 Showcase. [Pytorch / D-Wave]

2024.05 - Present | Research Supervisor - IYPT Canadian Physics Camp · Mentored Canada's National Physics Team, resulting in two Bronze Medals at IYPT 2024 and 2025.
· Organized the national camp, developed experimental/theoretical guidelines, and delivered undergraduate-level lectures. [Matlab / COMSOL]
